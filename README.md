# Reinforcement-learning
In this repository, I explore some of the most famous algorithms used in reinforcement learning problems. I show how to apply dynamprogramming methods to solve a basic Markov Decision Process: controlled queueing system. I code the  TD(0) and LSTD algorithms and study their convergence properties with different value Iteration, Policy Iteration and Soft Policy Iteration methods. 

Additionally, you will also find a basic implementation of the bandit algorithms in a task that reproduces some figures from the article by Chapelle and Li, (2011) "An Empirical Evaluation of Thompson Sampling". I show how to code both the UCB and Thompson algorithm. 

Finally you will find an implementation of a Bayesian optimization algorithm in the context of a Gaussian Process (GP). More specifically, I present how to apply a GP combined with UCB, EI and PI
