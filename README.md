# Reinforcement-learning
In this repository I explore some of the most famous algorithms use in reinforcement learning problems. I show how to apply dynamic programing methods for solving a basic Markov Decision Process such as TD(0), LSTD and how to explore some convergences properties of Soft Policy Interation.
